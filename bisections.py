#Project created by Oriol Tovar aka go fuck urself
#there's a couple of things this program can do that are amazing
#-Static time constriction in clip length
#-That's kind of it, but it's a big ass thing
 
#------TO RUN THIS PROGRAM------
#open the folder and copy paste the python codes, u can copy all the 9 codes and compile them on one but that's gay u know
#save it and load an image png of a arithmetic problem and let the program do the rest u fcking moron
#that's kind of it, it will print a result and if the result is not correct (i doubt it) u go fck urself

#it can solve problems like this one: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/2952/2018/01/31195027/CNX_UPhysics_11_01_RollNoSlip.jpg
